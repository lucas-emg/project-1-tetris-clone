# Why Tetris?

Tetris is a world-wide game that has rule both the fancy, up-to-date gaming consoles to the weird bootleg ones. But do you know where did Tetris come from?

Tetris was designed by Alex Pajitnov, a Russian computer engineer that worked for the Russian government in the 80's. Alex was fond of puzzle games, in special Pentomino, a puzzle game where you should try to fit square shaped pieces into one unique square (sounds familiar, right?).

Alex has developed Tetris in between working hours, as a passion project. Little did he know that the game would become a massive hit at his work and co-workers would share copies of the game that they would take home to play with their families.
